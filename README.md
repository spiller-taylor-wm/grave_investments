# grave_investments
Tyler Cantrell, Juan Chavez, Aiden Navarro, Taylor Spiller

Our project *Grave Investments* was created to help people plan funerals for their loved ones in the most convenient and user-friendly way possible.

We divided the work for our project evenly. Each of us has a page to work on:
Scrum Master Tyler made the scheduling page for reserving a funeral hall.
Developer Juan made the sign in and sign up pages.
Developer Taylor made the basic skeleton page and worked on the home page.
Project owner Aiden was in charge of the shop pages.
We all contributed to debugging the navigation bar and sliders. These were found for free and edited to suit our website.

Areas to focus on:
- We had to edit the navigation bar many times to get it to work correctly. Many parts of the CSS page are edited out to prevent it from reverting into mobile mode which messed up the page when it was too small. This was a large group effort and took a considerable amount of time.
- Our shop pages were carefully planned and edited to make the table cells evenly sized and spaced out so they would be uniform across pages.
